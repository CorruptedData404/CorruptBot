# CorruptBot

My personal discord bot created using discord.js. It has some server commands I find useful such as /timestamp and /roll but also many others just for fun or experience to code.

When sharing a docker network with a minecraft server hosted using https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server the bot is able to preform commands on the server, regularly check the status of the server (additionally sent status messages to a specified role's dms and/or a discord channel), and manage the whitelist.
